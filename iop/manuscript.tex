\begin{abstract}
This document describes the  preparation of an article using \LaTeXe\ and 
\verb"iopart.cls" (the IOP Publishing \LaTeXe\ preprint class file).
This class file is designed to help 
authors produce preprints in a form suitable for submission to any of the
journals listed in table X on the next page.  You are not obliged to use this class file---we accept
submissions using all common \LaTeX\ class and style files.  The \verb"iopart.cls"
class file is supplied merely as a convenience for those authors who find it useful.
This document gives both general advice that applies whatever class file you use, and specific advice
that applies if you choose to use \verb"iopart.cls".
